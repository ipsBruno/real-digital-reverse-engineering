# Real Digital CBDC Reverse Engineering 🕵️‍♂️💻

This project is an attempt to reverse engineer the Real Digital Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) smart contracts. As the source code for Real Digital was not made publicly available, only the ABIs were provided. Therefore, I took it upon myself to reverse engineer and infer the functionality of some of the functions.

Please note that this project is based on reverse engineering efforts and may not fully capture the actual implementation or intended behavior of the Real Digital CBDC. Use this code for reference and educational purposes only.

## Disclaimer ⚠️

The Real Digital CBDC contracts are the property of the Central Bank and their development team. This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Central Bank. Use this project at your own risk.

## Features ✨

- Reverse engineered implementation of selected Real Digital CBDC functions
- Educational resource for understanding CBDC contract structures and behaviors
